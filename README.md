Timer and countdown programs that can be adjust.

## FYI i'm using ESP32 as my microcontroller
You can see the code in the "countdown-timer2.ino" files

that code including my modification over conditions such as :
#### 1. Timer will start after we type/inputing the hours,minutes,and seconds timer as we wants
#### 2. After we configuring the timer, we must push the start button connecting to pin D5
#### 3. Timer start until its done
#### 4. you can reset the timer by pushing the reset button connecting to pin D18

any advice will be great !
